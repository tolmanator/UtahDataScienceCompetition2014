# I noticed that there were not a lot of data points in between 200 and 600. This led me to think that it would be important

# I generated a list of variables whose last appearance in the data set was above 200. I then listed their last 5 values and then
# calculated the slope between each point. From there I calculated the standard deviation of the slopes and started picking
# variables that had a low standard deviation, a shallow slope, high frequency, and then other random variables to test
# the techniques that I thought were yielding good results. Anytime I found a variable that decreased my score, it was added
# to the list. This is a very inelegant way of approaching the problem, but the size of the dataset, the issue with decay in the
# data, and the fact that we were given an opportunity to submit multiple times made it a viable option to increase my score by
# the needed points to come out ahead in the competition.
